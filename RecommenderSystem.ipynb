    "# **Introduction**\n",
    "Recommender Systems have become an integral part of modern-day technology. These systems are designed to provide personalized recommendations similar to those made by friends or family members. By offering suggestions based on user preferences, these systems help customers find new and exciting products while reducing decision-making fatigue. In addition, recommender systems help businesses increase sales and improve customer satisfaction by offering tailored recommendations that cater to the user's needs. Examples of these systems can be found on popular websites such as YouTube, which suggests videos based on viewing history, or Netflix, which recommends movies based on past watches.\n",
    "\n",
    "By working on this challenge, I will have the opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world data. I will be working with a large dataset and have to perform data cleaning, data preprocessing, and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge will allow me to gain hands-on experience in building and fine-tuning a recommendation algorithm using the K-Nearest Neighbors approach. I will be using the NearestNeighbors algorithm from scikit-learn to develop a model that can suggest similar books to a given book title. This is a valuable skill that can be applied to various fields such as e-commerce, social media, and entertainment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this challenge can provide me with an opportunity to learn and practice essential data science skills, machine learning, and programming. It can also be a fun and engaging way to apply my knowledge and challenge myself to develop a functional recommendation system."

    "### **Challenge description**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you will create a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the Book-Crossings dataset. This dataset contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.\n",
    "\n",
    "After importing and cleaning the data, use NearestNeighbors from sklearn.neighbors to develop a model that shows books that are similar to a given book. The Nearest Neighbors algorithm measures the distance to determine the “closeness” of instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function named get_recommends that takes a book title (from the dataset) as an argument and returns a list of 5 similar books with their distances from the book argument."

    "### **What are the main functions of a recommender system?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main functions of a recommender system are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To assist users in discovering new items or products of interest that they may not have been aware of otherwise. This involves providing personalized recommendations to users based on their past behavior, preferences, and interactions with the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To help businesses increase their sales and improve customer satisfaction by offering tailored recommendations that cater to the user's needs. By providing relevant suggestions, businesses can improve their conversion rates, reduce customer churn, and enhance customer loyalty."

    "#### Content-based filtering\n",
    "Content-based filtering makes recommendations by using keywords and attributes assigned to objects in a database (e.g., items in an online marketplace) and matching them to a user profile. The user profile is created based on data derived from a user’s actions, such as purchases, ratings (likes and dislikes), downloads, items searched for on a website and/or placed in a cart, and clicks on product links.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collaborative filtering\n",
    "Collaborative filtering focuses on the ratings of the items given by users. It is based on the \"Wisdom of the crowd\" and predicts suggested items based on the taste information from other users, i.e., recommendations are from collaborative user ratings. "
